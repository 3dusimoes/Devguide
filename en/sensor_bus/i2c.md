# I2C Bus Overview

I2C is a packet-switched serial communication protocol that allows multiple master devices to connect to multiple slave devices using only 2 wires per connection. It is intended for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. 
Pixhawk/PX4 support it for connecting off board components that require greater data rates than provided by a strict serial UART: e.g. rangefinders.
