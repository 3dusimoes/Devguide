# Contributing

Contact information for the core dev team and community can be found below. The PX4 project uses a three-branch Git branching model:

  * [master](https://github.com/px4/firmware/tree/master) is by default unstable and sees rapid development.
  * [beta](https://github.com/px4/firmware/tree/beta) has been thoroughly tested. Its intended for flight testers.
  * [stable](https://github.com/px4/firmware/tree/stable) points to the last release branch.

We try to retain a [linear history through rebases](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history) and avoid the [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). However, due to the global team and fast moving development we might resort to merges at times.

To contribute new functionality, [sign up for Github](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/), then [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository, [create a new branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/), add your changes, and finally [send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Changes will be merged when they pass our [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) tests.

All contributions have to be under the permissive [BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) and all code must not impose any further constraints on the use.

## Tests Flight Results

Test flights are important for quality assurance. Please upload the logs from the microSD card to [Log Muncher](http://logs.uaventure.com) and share the link on the [forum](http://groups.google.com/group/px4users) along with a verbal flight report.
