# Hardware

This section contains developer topics about modifying PX4 to work with *new* hardware, including airfames, autopilots, companion computers, sensors, and other peripherals. 
It also contains high level information about hardware that PX4 already supports.

> **Tip** The [PX4 User Guide](https://docs.px4.io/en/) contains more detailed information about using and configuring hardware that is already supported.
