# Autopilot Hardware (Flight Controllers)

PX4 runs on many [flight controller boards and systems](https://docs.px4.io/en/flight_controller/).
PX4 users can download pre-built firmware for supported (or custom) [airframes](../airframes/airframe_reference.md) using *QGroundControl* [Firmware update](https://docs.px4.io/en/config/firmware.html).

Flight controller topics relevant to developers include:

* [Building the Code](../setup/building_px4.md) - How to build firmware for the different controllers 
* [Porting Guide](../debug/porting-guide.md) - How to port PX4 to new flight controller hardware
